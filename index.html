        Hello! I'm a Corporate Technical Trainer who's passionate about Full-stack Development (FSD), Programming, and Cloud Computing. Before transitioning to corporate training in July 2021, I worked as a freelance Full-stack Developer and Technical Trainer since 2017. During this time, I conducted several training programs for students in senior colleges in Navi Mumbai, where I covered a broad range of topics such as Python, JAVA, PHP, SQL Databases, JavaScript - Angular, React, Node, MongoDB, Git, REST API, Deployment, Cloud Computing, and AWS. One of my most significant achievements was being selected by NPC (National Productivity Council) India (Under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) as a Full-stack Development Trainer, which was a great honor and recognition of my technical skills. As a Corporate Technical Trainer, I'm committed to helping organizations upskill their employees with the latest technology and best practices in Full-stack Development and Cloud Computing using AWS. Feel free to connect with me to learn more about my experience and how I can help you or your organization.
